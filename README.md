Project Overview
The Spam Detection System is designed to analyze and classify text messages or emails into spam or non-spam categories. This system uses various machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in spam detection.

Features
Text Classification: Classify messages as spam or non-spam.
Model Training: Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
Preprocessing: Text preprocessing including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
User Interface: A simple interface for testing the model with new messages (optional).
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
NLTK / SpaCy: For natural language processing tasks.
Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model testing.
Flask/Django: (Optional) For creating a web interface.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection-system.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd spam-detection-system
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code

Usage
Preprocess Data: Load and preprocess your dataset using the provided scripts.
Train Models: Use the training scripts to train your models on the preprocessed data.
Evaluate Models: Assess the performance of your models using evaluation metrics.
Test with New Data: Use the provided interface or scripts to classify new messages.
For detailed instructions on each step, refer to the docs directory.

Data
The project requires a dataset of messages for training and evaluation. You can use publicly available datasets like the SMS Spam Collection Dataset or any other relevant dataset. Ensure that your dataset is in the expected format (CSV, JSON, etc.).
